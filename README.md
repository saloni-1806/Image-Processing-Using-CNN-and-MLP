# Image-Processing-Using-CNN-and-MLP
The primary goal of this project is to classify images from two well-known datasets: MNIST (digits) and Fashion-MNIST (clothing items). The task involves training and evaluating two distinct neural network architectures MLP and CNN to understand their performance differences and suitability for image classification tasks.
